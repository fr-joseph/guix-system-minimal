* reminder from the guix manual

** 3.7 After System Installation

you can update the system whenever you want by running, say:

#+begin_src shell

guix pull
sudo guix system reconfigure /etc/config.scm

#+end_src

This builds a new system generation with the latest packages and
services.. We recommend doing that regularly so that your system
includes the latest security updates.

Note: Note that =sudo guix= runs your user’s guix command and not
root’s, because sudo leaves PATH unchanged. To explicitly run root’s
guix, type =sudo -i guix …=.

The difference matters here, because =guix pull= updates the guix
command and package definitions =only for the user it is run as=. This
means that if you choose to use guix system reconfigure in root’s
login shell, you’ll need to guix pull separately.

* post install steps

** from user login shell

#+begin_src shell

# update root's guix (run this once in a while)
# include nonguix channel
sudo -i guix pull --channels="./base-channels.scm" --allow-downgrades

# include nonguix channel
guix pull --channels="./base-channels.scm" --allow-downgrades

# include nonguix subs
SUBS='https://ci.guix.gnu.org https://bordeaux.guix.gnu.org https://substitutes.nonguix.org'
sudo guix system \
     --substitute-urls="$SUBS" \
     --cores=0 \
     reconfigure "/etc/system.scm"

#+end_src
